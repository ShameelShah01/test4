						<h2>Personality Tests</h2>

				<p>The personality test results shown below does quite accurately describes how I am as a person. I continuously try to improve myself in all aspects of my life, as I believe that we all learn new things every single day. I am usually quiet around people who I do not know (introverted), but I can say that I do get very friendly with time and feel comfortable once introduced or have a conversation with a person.  </p>
		<p>Whichever task I am required to do, big or small, I try to be vigilant as much as possible. I would not say that I like to rush into things as I have experienced that you do not achieve good successful outcomes by being hasty. I also feel it is better to start doing a task earlier to avoid disappointment.</p>
		<p>As part of a team, I will introduce myself, get to know each other, and get comfortable with my team members to help us work better as a team. Also, I will start with my allocated task, which I will be required to do on the same day even if it is starting with the smallest bit to begin it and provide my work on time to my group, as that will also allow me to be mindful with the work I will be doing.  
			<p>However, I will say I am still new around this and still learning. I will avoid as many mistakes and work as hard as possible.    </p>
			<p>While forming a group, I feel communication is essential, if we communicate well, we can be transparent with each other, and we can work together better. As part of a group, I will ensure that I work at my best and deliver my allocated task on time and hope my group members do the same. I will try my level best to provide satisfactory work for my group.</p>
