						<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							
			<p>Batar-It App - A mordan and Simple Way To Barter</p>
						</header>

						<!-- Idea --> <h1</h1>
							<section>
								<h3> <u>Concept</u>
								<p>This will be a free app available for everyone in both the Apple IOS Store and Android Store</b> and will be providing users to list for free of charge. However, to have full access, the user must be signed up and become a member to list. Non-members can freely navigate the app and view items listed. However, they will not be able to barter items, and the traders' personal information will be hidden, for example, phone contact, trader's name.  This app will allow members to list items for free which they wish to barter, with a detailed description of the items, including location, condition of the item, and possibly a picture for the item's illustration purpose. If they provide service, details should be mentioned clearly, including services offered, location, and possible time to deliver the particular service. The individual also must state what they require in exchange.</p>
									 

								<header>
									<h3><u>Steps And Features</u></h3>
									<u>Step one,</u>  If someone is interested in barter, the person should touch on a "Barter" button (similar to a "Buy Now" button in apps like eBay). They will also be required to tick a box that will state that they have accepted the offer and are willing to barter for the owner's required items or services.  
									<p></p><u>Step two,</u>  The person who listed will receive a notification on his app and email stating that a particular person is interested in his offer. As he agrees with the barter request from his app or email, a confirmation email and a text message will be sent to the person interested, stating the owner's name and contact information.  
								<p></p><u>Step three,</u>    Both parties will now have access to each other's contact information, allowing them to further discuss the exchange of items or services. 
									<p></p>This app will also allow people to give things away for free. For example, if a person wants to dispose of a particular item, they can list it on this app. If anyone is interested, one can contact the owner, arrange a pickup, and use it. In this case, both parties have a win-win situation as the owner has cleared and made space, and the other person has made use of something for free.

								<p>In the future, the app can earn money for the developer by running ads or for companies and introducing a marketplace for people who wish to sell items using this app. For example, putting up a for sale listing will cost $2.00AUD per listing, but still, keep the option to barter for free. The app can also introduce a premium membership costing $14.99AUD per annum, a one-off payment that will give its members extra benefits. For example, two from the many benefits can include,</p>
						<p>-Once signed up for premium membership, and the premium user can have 8-10 listings to list in the marketplace for free, which must be redeemed before the membership expiry. </p>
						<p></p>-The Premium users can also have access to list in the featured section in the marketplace, allowing his listings for a greater reach. 
					
					<p></p>	This app can compete with other similar apps like eBay but have the cheapest membership cost with its members' best benefits.

								<h2Tool</h2>
								<h3><u>Tools And Technologies Required</u> </h3>
								<p>Developing the app will require Xcode and Swift for IOS development and Android Studio and Java for Android Development. Swift and Java are the programming language, whereas Xcode and Android Studio will be software development tools.  </p>
								<p>Below are a few more of the requirements needed to develop the app:
									<p>- Sketch- A graphic design tool that will primarily come in use to design the UI and UX of the app.
										<p>- Firebase, Realm or Core data- for storage and database.
											<p>- Fastlane and Jenkins- to automate the workflow for publishing the app.
												<p>- PaintCode- transforms UI components visually built into code running.
													<p>- Appium- will be used to test the app.</p>
												</p>
											</p>
										</p>
									</p>
								</p>
								<p></p>

								<h3><u>Skills Required</u> </h3>
								<blockquote> As it is probably the most crucial aspect of app development, building a high-quality user interface (UI) is required. The app must be easy to use, have a good design layout, and run well. </blockquote>
								<p>-The developer must be able to create apps in both Apple IOS and Android versions. These two are the major mobile platforms.</p>
<p>-         Must know Modern Language programming Skills such as Java and Swift and knowledge in Xcode and Android Studio as these two are the primary skills required to develop an app.
	<p>-         Be familiar with mobile platform application programming interfaces (API) such as Apple IOS and Android.
		
		<p>Developing an app from scratch can require a lot of knowledge and time. Researching will be required, and including one or two skillful people can be beneficial and an excellent opportunity to learn from their experiences. All the software is available to download or use online and is available on the trial version. However, to gain full access, the full version must be purchased.</p>
		
		<p><h3><u>Outcome</u> </h3></p>
		<p>Once this app is developed successfully, people in Australia will have access to an app that will allow Australians to exchange goods and services without monetary exchange using the barter system concept. COVID 19 has impacted Australia's economy, and by that, individuals have also been affected in one way or another.
			<p>Therefore, this app will allow people to exchange items and services without any monetary exchange. People who need certain items or require certain services and wish not to use their hard-earned money can use this app and take advantage from it, along with them, this app can come to use to a significant number of people in Australia. 
				<p>This tradition can continue in which people can still benefit from as this app will make the barter system easier through a well-developed and user friendly app.</p>
