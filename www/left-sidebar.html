									<h3>Interest In IT</h3>
									<p>As growing up in this modern era and being surrounded by all the great technology, I can say my utmost interest till now has been in AI (Artificial Intelligence), Mobile App Development, Web Development, Graphics Designing, and the current and upcoming technologies. My interest most developed in IT during my high school days, when I was working part-time as a junior administrator. The position enabled me to explore the world of computer technology and learn about the basics skills of computer, web development and graphic designing.
										<p>I also spent time with my senior work colleagues and was a part of their conversation regarding all the new and upcoming technologies during those days and I started developing more of my interest. My brother, who is also a part of the IT industry, similarly sparked my interest by sharing his work experiences. I decided that I wanted to be a part of the IT industry as well.</p>
										<p>I currently have some knowledge in web development, graphic designing, and basic computer technology. I am really looking forward to learning more and expanding my knowledge and skills in Information Technology.  
<p>I have chosen RMIT because I have come across only this university, which offers this course online. Also, I have heard good things about RMIT from a friend in Melbourne who is familiar with RMIT and recommended me to study with this university as he graded it one of the top universities in Australia. 
<p>In this course, I hope to learn the fundamentals of Information technology and have a much better understanding of IT. I am currently just a beginner with not much knowledge, but I am really hoping to learn along the way.</p>

		<h2>Personality Tests</h2>

<p>The personality test results shown below does quite accurately describes how I am as a person. I continuously try to improve myself in all aspects of my life, as I believe that we all learn new things every single day. I am usually quiet around people who I do not know (introverted), but I can say that I do get very friendly with time and feel comfortable once introduced or have a conversation with a person.  </p>
<p>Whichever task I am required to do, big or small, I try to be vigilant as much as possible. I would not say that I like to rush into things as I have experienced that you do not achieve good successful outcomes by being hasty. I also feel it is better to start doing a task earlier to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>As part of a team, I will introduce myself, get to know each other, and get comfortable with my team members to help us work better as a team. Also, I will start with my allocated task, which I will be required to do on the same day even if it is starting with the smallest bit to begin it and provide my work on time to my group, as that will also allow me to be mindful with the work I will be doing.  
<p>However, I will say I am still new around this and still learning. I will avoid as many mistakes and work as hard as possible.    </p>
<p>While forming a group, I feel communication is essential, if we communicate well, we can be transparent with each other, and we can work together better. As part of a group, I will ensure that I work at my best and deliver my allocated task on time and hope my group members do the same. I will try my level best to provide satisfactory work for my group.</p>

										<h3> Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software Engineer</h3>
										<p>Being an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software Engineer will be a dream for me; I would like to be a part of the development process of new AI software and maintain it. Becoming an engineer in this field also matches one of my interests; for example, working for Tesla as an AI software engineer will be a dream job, as I am interested in both cars and technology. My knowledge in AI is developing, and I am hoping to learn more in time to come.

									<h3>The qualifications required:
									</h3>
									<p> <li> Completed a Computer Science degree or have a similar technical field of study or have an equal amount of practical experience in the same area.</li> 

										<p> <li> Be familiar with machine learning frameworks, for example; Keras and PyTorch are tools which help AI developers to develop a machine learning model; it helps by saving time and allowing developers to design a model in a much faster phase and also making it easier for the developers to come up with a model.
											<p> <li> Able to bring into effect and maintain models on the edge and cloud setup. For example, one must know about cloud computing and know-how to maintain and set up models.
												<p> <li> Create and optimize models using various techniques such as quantization pruning. For example, being able to identify what parts are necessary and what is not needed.
													<p> <li> Working as a team and even individuals and communicating clearly with engineers in the workforce, including non- software and data science background. 
														<p> <li>Support hardware decision-making and bring into effective use, including edge processing and air-gapped and low bandwidth solutions.
															<p> <li>Previous experience highly considered and be a plus point to both employer and employee.
																<p> <li> Create models using phytom and having good knowledge and experience in SQL. For example, good knowledge in programming and managing data and running Phyton and R scripts with relational data.

																</p>I am currently just a beginner in the information technology world, and the only bit of experience I have related is a bit of graphic designing, web development, and some good computer knowledge. In my free time, I read about app development and Artificial intelligence, which I plan to learn more about in the future.

															</p>I plan on taking my IT interests further and studying more. In the future, I am planning to attain a degree in software engineering and being able to qualify for a similar job, as mentioned. I plan to switch my career and to work (part-time) while studying for the IT industry to gain more experience and better understand.
